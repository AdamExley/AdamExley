### Hi, I'm Adam Exley!

Most of my public work has  directed towards developing the [RoPE-S3D](https://github.com/OSU-AIMS/RoPE-S3D) repository as a part of the [AIMS Lab](https://github.com/OSU-AIMS) at the Ohio State University. This repository evolved from the [DeepPoseRobot](https://github.com/OSU-AIMS/DeepPoseRobot) repository, also authored by me. 
Both repositores aimed to detect the joint angles of a 6-axis robotic arm.

<br>

I have a couple projects in-the-works that may *soon* be public, but until then, take a look around!

I recommend you check out my (ever-evolving) website at [AdamExley.com](https://adamexley.com).

Feel free to contact me at [exley.8@osu.edu](mailto:exley.8@osu.edu) if you have any questions about me or my work.
