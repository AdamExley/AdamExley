### Hi, I'm Adam Exley!

I recommend you check out my (ever-evolving) website at [AdamExley.com](https://adamexley.com). It has more info than this (by a long shot).


Most of my public work was directed towards developing the [RoPE-S3D](https://github.com/OSU-AIMS/RoPE-S3D) repository as a part of the [AIMS Lab](https://github.com/OSU-AIMS) at the Ohio State University.
This repository evolved from the [DeepPoseRobot](https://github.com/OSU-AIMS/DeepPoseRobot) repository, also authored by me. 
Both repositores aimed to detect the joint angles of a 6-axis robotic arm.

I also developed a GPU-accelerated geometric spray process (spray paint) simulator under the AIMS Lab, which I'm very proud of (although it's not public yet).

Anymore I tend to focus my programming on test and measurement automation as well as low-level firmware and drivers for test and measurement instruments.
