### Hi, I'm Adam Exley!

Currently, I'm diving into Augmented Reality programming with C# and Unity!

Most of my previous work was directed towards developing the [RoPE-S3D](https://github.com/OSU-AIMS/RoPE-S3D) repository as a part of the [AIMS Lab](https://github.com/OSU-AIMS) at the Ohio State University. This repository evolved from the [DeepPoseRobot](https://github.com/OSU-AIMS/DeepPoseRobot) repository, also authored by me. 
Both repositores aimed to detect the joint angles of a 6-axis robotic arm.

I recommend you check out my (ever-evolving) [GitHub pages site](https://adamexley.github.io).

Feel free to contact me at [exley.8@osu.edu](mailto:exley.8@osu.edu) if you have any questions about me or my work.
