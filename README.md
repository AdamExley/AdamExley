## Hi, I'm Adam Exley!

I recommend you check out my (ever-evolving) website at [AdamExley.com](https://adamexley.com). It has more info than this (by a long shot).

I try to keep it (somewhat) up-to-date, whereas this is... well you can see when it was last edited, right?


### Research 
I did ungradudate research as a part of the [AIMS Lab](https://github.com/OSU-AIMS) at the Ohio State University.

A majority of my work there was focused on GPU-accelerated (CUDA) paint simulations, but that work isn't public.

However, I did develop the [RoPE-S3D](https://github.com/OSU-AIMS/RoPE-S3D) repository.
This repository evolved from the [DeepPoseRobot](https://github.com/OSU-AIMS/DeepPoseRobot) repository, also authored by me. 
Both repositores aimed to detect the joint angles of a 6-axis robotic arm.
